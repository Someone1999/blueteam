In Linux, user sessions can be monitored and managed using various commands and log files. Here are some key ways to check user-created sessions:


---

1️⃣ Checking Active Sessions (who, w, last, utmp, etc.)

🔹 View Currently Logged-in Users

who

or

w

Shows active users and their session details.


🔹 View User Login History

last

Displays the list of user logins, showing timestamps and session duration.


🔹 Check Active User Sessions (utmp file)

who /var/run/utmp

utmp file keeps track of current user sessions.



---

2️⃣ Checking User Sessions from Logs (auth.log & journalctl)

🔹 View Login Attempts from auth.log

(Ubuntu/Debian-based systems)

sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "session opened"

or

sudo grep "session" /var/log/auth.log

Shows when user sessions are opened and closed.


🔹 View Session History using journalctl

(RHEL-based systems)

journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=systemd-logind.service | grep "session"

Displays logs related to user session activities.



---

3️⃣ Checking Active User Sessions via systemctl

loginctl list-sessions

Shows all active sessions, including remote SSH and local logins.


loginctl show-session <SESSION_ID>

Get detailed information about a specific user session.



---

4️⃣ Checking SSH Sessions

🔹 Active SSH Connections

who | grep pts

Lists users connected via SSH.


or

ss -tnp | grep sshd

Displays active SSH connections.


🔹 View SSH Login History

last | grep "sshd"

Shows past SSH logins.



---

5️⃣ Killing a User Session

If you need to terminate a user session:

sudo pkill -KILL -u <username>

or

sudo loginctl terminate-session <SESSION_ID>

Kills a specific user session.

🔴 Conclusion

To monitor user-created sessions in Linux:
✅ Use who, w, last for live sessions
✅ Check /var/log/auth.log or journalctl for session history
✅ Use loginctl to manage systemd sessions
✅ Monitor SSH connections with ss or who | grep pts
